Motorola ONT is an optical network terminal. ONT is commonly found in
residential unit that connects the ISP's fibre optic network and
provides Ethernet connectivity to the home.

Specification
=============

Physical Description

Features and Benefits
---------------------

* Flexibility
    * Revenue growth and building a powerful defense against
        competitors are key

reasons service providers need to consider the deployment of next
generation fiber access technologies. Multi-service delivery over a
single converged FTTP and FTTN platform provides the flexibility to
offer “triple play” and additional advanced IPTV services. The converged
platform provides revenue generating services and allows service
providers to take advantage of improved deployment economics and greater
operational simplicity.

Interoperability
----------------

The ONT1400GT is in compliance with industry standard FSAN and ITU-T
G.984 specifications to allow interworking with third party vendors. The
ONT1400GT is also designed to interoperate with Motorola’s line of RF
and combination RF/IP set top terminals.

Management
----------

The AXS2200 FTTP and FTTN access networks and ONT1400GT are managed by a
comprehensive element management system that enables visibility into
system performance, service continuity, service provisioning,
maintenance and upgrades from a single operations center.
